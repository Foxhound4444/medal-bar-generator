# Medal bar generator

This is a little application which procedurally generates fake [medal ribbons][Wikipedia: Medal ribbon]

## Why?

I was looking for some kind of (digital) badges that I could award to members of my team for their accomplishments. 
Military style medal ribbons was one idea, but I didn't want to deface any actual award. 
That's why I decided to make an application that would generate designs similar to actual medal ribbons. 

## How?

* The application has a couple of general ribbon layouts to choose from (both symmetric and asymmetric). 
* It selects a color palette for a ribbon from an [official list used by US Military][Wikipedia: Medal ribbon]
* It applies a verticall grille battern to simulate ribbon threads
* Finally it randomly decides whether to apply some [award devices][Wikipedia: United States military award devices]
